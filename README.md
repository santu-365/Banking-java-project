🩺 Health-Care Project
📌 What is this project?

This is a Java Spring Boot–based Health-Care application built with Maven. It provides a basic structure for healthcare management—where you can extend features like patient records, appointments, billing, or hospital workflows. The repo includes infrastructure automation to make deployment easier using Docker and Ansible.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Backend: Java, Spring Boot

Build Tool: Maven

Containerization: Docker

Configuration Management / Deployment: Ansible

Monitoring (suggested): Prometheus + Grafana / ELK Stack (depending on setup)

🚀 How to Run Locally

Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/santu-365/health-care.git
cd health-care


Build the project

./mvnw clean install


Run the Spring Boot app

java -jar target/health-care-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar


Access the app at:

http://localhost:8080

🐳 Running with Docker

Build Docker image

docker build -t healthcare-app .


Run the container

docker run -p 8080:8080 healthcare-app

📦 Deploying with Ansible

Use the provided ansible-playbook.yml to deploy on a remote server:

ansible-playbook -i inventory ansible-playbook.yml


Make sure:

Your target server has Docker installed.

SSH access is configured.

📊 Monitoring

To keep the application healthy in production:

Container Metrics: Use docker stats or Prometheus Node Exporter.

Application Metrics: Integrate Spring Boot Actuator → exposes /actuator/health and other endpoints.

Visualization: Hook Prometheus to Grafana for dashboards.

Logging: Send logs to ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or use Loki + Grafana.

✅ Next Steps

Add API docs (Swagger/OpenAPI)

Secure endpoints with authentication

Expand CI/CD (GitHub Actions / Jenkins)

Extend monitoring for error tracking (Sentry/ELK)

Would you like me to make this a polished README.md file and push the updated version here (ready to paste), or do you want me to keep it just as raw content so you can insert where needed?

You said:
why i cant copy points symbol it pastes as plain no point wise
ChatGPT said:

That happens because GitHub README uses Markdown formatting, not plain text. If you just copy from chat/Word, the bullets might lose their style.

Here’s how you can make sure points show up properly:

In Markdown (README.md)

Use - or * followed by a space.

Example:

## Features
- User authentication with login/signup
- Book doctor appointments online
- Store and access patient records
- Admin dashboard for monitoring


This will render as:

User authentication with login/signup

Book doctor appointments online

Store and access patient records

Admin dashboard for monitoring

If you want numbered points:
## Steps to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Start the server
4. Open browser at localhost


Renders as:

Clone the repo

Install dependencies

Start the server

Open browser at localhost

👉 So don’t try to copy the “●” or “•” symbol directly. Use Markdown syntax instead (-, *, or 1.).

Do you want me to write the exact Markdown block for your project (features + hosting + monitoring steps) so you can just paste it into your README?

Perfect. I’ve got both files, so here’s a polished README.md you can drop directly into your Banking-java-project repo.
It combines the project details (from the FinanceMe problem statement
) with the execution steps (from the Capstone setup guide
).

# 🏦 Banking and Finance Project – FinanceMe

## 📌 Project Overview
FinanceMe is a **banking and financial services application** designed as part of a DevOps certification capstone.  
The project simulates a real-world **Banking & Finance domain system** and demonstrates the end-to-end DevOps lifecycle:
- Monolith to **Microservices migration** with Spring Boot
- **Automation with CI/CD** pipelines
- **Infrastructure as Code** using Terraform
- **Configuration Management** with Ansible
- **Containerization & Deployment** with Docker
- **Monitoring & Visualization** with Prometheus and Grafana

The app provides REST APIs to manage banking accounts and policies with AWS RDS MySQL integration.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
Originally deployed as a monolith, the application faced:
- Scaling issues under traffic spikes
- Manual testing/deployment overhead
- Difficulties in incremental builds
- Slow feedback between developers and testers
- Painful infrastructure provisioning and monitoring

**Solution:** Adopt microservices + DevOps automation to deliver features faster, more reliably, and with minimal manual effort:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, Maven
- **Database**: AWS RDS – MySQL, H2 (for POC)
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **IaC**: Terraform
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible
- **Test Automation**: JUnit, Selenium, TestNG
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Cloud**: AWS EC2

---

## 🚀 Features / APIs
Preloaded data in DB. Available REST endpoints:

- `POST /createAccount` → Create new account (JSON body)  
- `PUT /updateAccount/{accountNo}` → Update account details  
- `GET /viewPolicy/{accountNo}` → View account policy details  
- `DELETE /deletePolicy/{accountNo}` → Delete account policy  

---

## 🛠️ Project Execution Steps

### 1. Infrastructure Setup with Terraform
- Create AWS EC2 instances (`t2.medium` as Master server, `t2.micro` as Test server).  
- Configure Security Groups with inbound rules (22, 8080, 8081, 8084, 9090, 9100, 3000).  
- Commands:
  ```bash
  terraform init
  terraform plan
  terraform apply

2. Environment Setup (on Master server)

Install Java, Maven, Git (java.sh)

Install Jenkins (jenkins.sh)

Install Docker (apt install docker.io -y)

Install Ansible (ansible.sh)

3. Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

Stages included:

Checkout Code from GitHub

Build & Package with Maven

Run Unit Tests (JUnit/TestNG)

Build Docker Image from Dockerfile

Push Image to DockerHub

Deploy with Ansible on Test server

Trigger Selenium Automation for validation

4. Deployment

Application JAR deployed in container and exposed on port 8081 (Test) and 8084 (Prod).

5. Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana

Install Node Exporter on Master and Test servers (port 9100).

Configure Prometheus (port 9090) to scrape metrics.

Setup Grafana (port 3000) with Prometheus as data source.

Dashboards include:

CPU Utilization

Memory Usage

Disk Utilization
